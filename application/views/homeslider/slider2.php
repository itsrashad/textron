                        My Development Plan provides you the ability to create a 5 year plan to build essential skills and 
                        competencies necessary for your desired role. You can select a skill or competency that you need to 
                        develop and then choose from suggested activities and trainings applicable to your current role. 
                        If you don&rsquo;t like the suggestions, you can work with your manager to determine other opportunities. 
                        That&rsquo;s the greatest part, you decide your own destiny!

                        My Assessment begins the skill and competency review process with a self assessment. You can evaluate 
                        your current level of experience and proficiency in different skill sets. Your Assessment gives you the 
                        option to send an evaluation request to your peers and manager. This allows you to get the perspective 
                        of the people you interact with daily and provide more accurate results. With a clear understanding of
                        your current skill set you can better determine where to focus your development energies.
